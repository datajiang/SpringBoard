# Prices Auto Learning
A customer is always concerned about if the money paid for the product is worth it. Car is a commodity with sophisticated technological wonders built into it. In any kind of modern car, there exist deep knowledge bases in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerodynamics, software engineering, chemical engineering, automation, etc. 
Nobody has such full understanding and knowledge to make sound judgement of a new car’s price. Car value and reputation are usually based on many years user experience, popularity, quality testing, etc. 
To the majority of car buyers, it would be a great tool to use a data-driven objective model to find the best quality car with all technical features being taken into account.
